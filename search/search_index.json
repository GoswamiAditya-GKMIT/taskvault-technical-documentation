It is designed to support both individual task management and team-oriented workflows with strong access control and auditability.</p> <p>The system enables users to create and manage their own tasks, while administrators can assign tasks, monitor progress, and review task activity across the system. Every meaningful change to a task is recorded, ensuring transparency and traceability.</p> <p>TaskVault is API-first and can be integrated with any frontend application such as React, Vue, Flutter, or mobile clients.</p>"},{"location":"#problem-statement","title":"Problem Statement","text":"<p>Many task management systems fail to clearly separate responsibilities between regular users and administrators. They often lack strict access control, reliable task history, and structured handling of task ownership and assignment.</p> <p>TaskVault addresses these issues by providing:</p> <ul> <li>Clear separation between user-owned and admin-assigned tasks</li> <li>Structured priority and status tracking</li> <li>Secure, role-based access control</li> <li>Immutable audit history for task changes</li> <li>Soft deletion to preserve data integrity</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#proposed-solution","title":"Proposed Solution","text":"<p>TaskVault provides a structured backend solution

tasks</li> <li>Immutable task history for auditing</li> <li>Comment-based collaboration on tasks</li> <li>Soft delete strategy across all major entities</li> </ul> <p>This approach results in a
